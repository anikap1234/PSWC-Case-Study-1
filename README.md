# PSWC-Case-Study-1
 This project contains the code to calculate and present the report card of a college student in three examinations.
 
 It consists of three files:
 
 i) client code reportcard.c
 
 ii)source code report.c consisting of user defined functions
 
 iii) header file  report.h consisting of function declarations
 

 We use a Makefile which is a set of commands  with variable names and targets to create object file and to remove them. In a single make file we can create multiple targets to compile and to remove object, binary files.
